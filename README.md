# Date Countdown Microservice

This microservice reads a future date from `input.txt` and writes the number of days remaining until that date into `output.txt`.

## ðŸ“¦ How It Works

1. The main program (or user) writes a future date to `input.txt` in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
2. The microservice (`countdown.py`) reads the date, calculates how many days remain from today, and writes the result to `output.txt`.

## ðŸ§ª Example

**input.txt**
